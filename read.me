cd ~/bot && echo '# Future Assistant v1.0
A screen-reading, self-improving AI assistant powered by Ollama and LangChain.

## Vision
Compensate, innovate, adapt, adopt, learn, grow! Improve speed, troubleshoot, utilize resources (multiple terminals, RAM full, CPU idle). Expand to cloud/free resources (e.g., Groq API). Leverage Isaac’s YouTube subs for inspiration. Make it epic, positive, human-focused—grow unstoppable, organized, envelope-pushing! Daily news checks (started 2025-03-14) keep us ahead. Files < 400 lines, split at 500—copy-paste friendly, `nano` only if complex.

## Features
- **Voice I/O**: TTS via `pyttsx3`, mic input via `speech_recognition` (index 3, Pulse, gain-tuned via `pavucontrol`).
- **Tools**: Web search, math, screen reading.
- **Learning**: Feedback in `learning.json`.
- **Status**: Mic 98% (Pulse `index 3` confirmed), TTS live, Groq API integration next.
