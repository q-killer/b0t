Contact: youtube@rossmanngroup.com email me here & I'll read it!! email me elsewhere & I report it as spam. I started as a studio repair technician at Avatar & started a Macbook component level logic board repair business. This channel shows repair & data recovery work & shows how to perform these repairs step by step. There are many outside forces that make it hard to fix things now; willful actions from manufacturers to limit access to parts & schematics. I talked about this to try and spark mainstream recognition of the "Right to Repair" movement. I realized that restrictions placed on repair were just a canary-in the-coal-mine for many of the anti-ownership, anti-consumer practices that would become common in every industry, which I discuss & try to push back against every day.

The ingredients are: a GoPro, simple editing, curiosity, a search for truth, and most importantly, authentic human interactions. I‚Äôve lived abroad in four countries and traveled to 85. I've taken this perspective back to the USA to show Americans and the world what this great nation is like away from the mainstream media.

Hi everyone, and welcome to my channel! My name is Karlton Dennis, I am a licensed Enrolled Agent, based in the great state of California and I help anyone from small business owners to millionaires reduce their tax bills, legally, each year. By utilizing the tax codes that the government provides each year, I am able to reduce all of my clients tax bills, and even give some the freedom of living TAX FREE. I create informational videos for my viewers to learn about tax strategy. These videos are strictly for entertainment purposes only, and should not be construed as legal advice. Tax savings are available to anyone, with any career, but you have to educate yourself a little about the tax code so that you understand what is available to you, and if you're not reaching out to me, you need to know what you need to look for in a tax professional.

Oddly enough the channel is about empowerment. It is my belief that with creativity, experimentation and a get up and go attitude anything can be achieved. Link that with the use of local resources and a reduced need for expensive tools and equipment then you have empowerment and the ability to do anything for yourself if you need to. Don't get me wrong you don't have to do everything by yourself but I think you should be able to if you want to or need to.

Hey, I'm Vincent and my goal is to help you make smarter money moves. ... But to be honest, I wasn‚Äôt always good with money. My parents immigrated to the US with just a few dollars, and watching them struggle every day to provide for me and my siblings was one of the toughest things I ever had to witness. But one day, I had a realization. ‚Ä¶ That breaking the cycle of generational poverty only takes one person. So I asked myself, "Why can't that person be me?" This realization sparked a desire within me to learn everything about money. And let me tell you: it was HARD ‚Äî I had to figure everything out on my own. There were countless times I wanted to give up but I kept pushing through. Eventually, I got an Economics degree and then worked on Wall Street. But I always hated what I did at work: helping the rich get richer. So I left Wall Street and wanted to share everything I‚Äôve learned ‚Äî all the secrets of the wealthy ‚Äî to help people just like you.

The History Guy: History Deserves to Be Remembered

@TheHistoryGuyChannel‚Ä¢1.52M subscribers
History that deserves to be remembered. If you love history, this is the channel for you! Stories of forgotten history, all between five and fifteen minutes long. Episodes are posted Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings. I have always loved history and believe that history does not have to be boring. At its heart, history is story telling, and I believe that it should be told with passion and genuine love for the material. History might be tragic, it might be comic, but it is the story of who we are, and we should not be afraid to enjoy that story, and be moved by it. I live in the American Midwest, talk too fast but am working on that, and tie my own bow ties. Yes, the hats in the background are mine. Topic suggestions are always welcome.

Hi, I'm Jarrod. I'm passionate about Alternative Living, Building, and Travel - Year from Now You'll Wish You Started Toady - How I try and live life and why I try new things all the time. How I got here: Architectural Engineering degree then went into the corporate world. Few years of that I wanted to get into acting so moved to Los Angeles. Acting got me into improv and stand up comedy, which I absolutely loved. In 2016 I decided to build a van into a tiny home on wheels thinking I could live in LA while pursuing acting and stand up comedy. Lived in first van for 2 years and vlogged my journey, but also shared other peoples lives in the vanlife/travel community. Decided to step away from acting and comedy in 2019 to build a 2nd van and focus more on my YouTube channel to inspire others to do whatever they are passionate about. Since then I've built 2 other vans, a tiny home, and with hopes to keep building and designing many more small spaces...comedy might come back too!

Jimmy on Relationships

@JimmyonRelationships‚Ä¢1.17M subscribers
I confessed to my wife that I had an affair, and she kicked me out (rightfully so) and as I was sitting in my car alone wondering if I should text my mom or sleep in my car I asked myself "was this pain I'm experiencing preventable? Can my marriage be saved even after an affair? What does a healthy relationship even look like?" I couldn't stop obsessing over these types of questions, and after reading dozens of books on relationships and eventually rebuilding trust in my marriage, I decided this is too important not to talk about and share what I've learned with others. So I hope I can help your relationship in any way that I can. *I am NOT a coach or counselor and my videos are NEVER intended to replace counseling or therapy =)

I drive a Mini. 5. The other people who help make these videos are Emma (who assists with building all sorts of things), Hannah (who films the big tests), and other friends who enjoy helping out from time-to-time. 6.

Welcome to the Jon's RC channel! We are a dad, mom and son RC team! Jon is the primary RC pilot. Jon and I build the planes. His mom does the video recording, Jon does the video editing and I publish the final product. Jon got into RC airplanes with the 3-channel Hobby Zone Champ. He quickly learned to fly the 3-channel Champ and transitioned to 4 plus channel planes. Now, Jon can fly just about any RC model that can fly including Jet, 3-D planes, and Collective Pitch Helis! I created this channel so that we can give an honest review on RC airplanes and helicopters. Our goal is to promote the RC hobby in a fun and safe way. Although Jon makes flying RC airplanes and helicopters look easy, they are NOT necessarily easy to fly! Jon has been flying RC models for a few years now and is no longer a beginner.

On the shore of the Pacific Ocean, when I was ten years old, in a flame of a fire blown by the cold northerly wind, on a smooth stone from the surf, I forged my first sword from a piece of the wreck of a ship thrown ashore and almost rotted from the salty storms. I still remember the star sparks of fire, carried away to their heavenly brothers, and the warm light of the heated metal suddenly became pliable in children's hands. It was then, in the twilight of the polar night, the fire gave me spiritual harmony, from the ability to change the world around, he gave me the power to hear steel.

Airguns of Alaska
@airgunsofalaska‚Ä¢3.72K subscribers
Hi YouTube, I‚Äôve been shooting airguns since ‚Äò81 and it‚Äôs been a hobby I‚Äôve stuck with since I was a kid. A couple years ago during an especially rainy fall I decided to create a sub channel off my power-sports focused YouTube account and start making videos of the airguns in my private collection. That led me to buying new airguns and featuring them on my channel. As time progressed I realized I could create my version of the original concept of Dirt Bike magazine with the late, great Rick (Super Hunky) Seiman. His vision was just one regular guy talking about dirt bikes to other regular guys. I thought that‚Äôd be a really neat thing for the airgun world. Feel free to post any questions or comments. I‚Äôm generally quick to respond and enjoy reading viewer feedback. Thanks for checking out my channel! I can be contacted at thatalaskaguy907@gmail.com

I firmly believe that anyone who learns the skill sets of a millionaire can become a millionaire, ANYONE. My Story: I left school at 16 with no qualifications and no money. No one believed in me especially my teachers. My first job was making wooden trash cans, and it paid less than $2 per hour. My manager bullied me and gave me all the bad jobs. I decided to quit and start my own business, it was a big risk. 30 years later... I run a multi-million dollar business. I have grossed over 50 million. I have the house of my dreams and most importantly I have the freedom to spend time with my family. Now I want to help you become financially free as well.

I've been riding freight trains since 1989 and have since ridden over 2,700,000 of steel rails in 49 USA states, eight provinces of Canada and 14 states in Mexico. I spent my first 31 years homeless riding trains then last year I had to get a small apartment because of medical issues. It's very hard having walls and a roof because I prefer to be outside. I still stay gone riding more than I stay in the little apartment. Doing my best after getting hit by a car December 13 and ran over by a train October 2017. Hand and arm healed quite well! I now have a merchandise website at the below link: https://officialhoboshoestring.com Thanks for watching!

LabCoatz is a science and engineering-based YouTube channel dedicated to bringing you amazing projects and scientific content that is hard to find on video anywhere else. We've filmed several YouTube-firsts (like its first look at both thioacetone and resiniferatoxin: the stinkiest and spiciest chemicals on Earth, respectively), and we don't intend to stop any time soon! This channel was founded on the idea that people shouldn't have to scour the whole Internet for the information they seek: they should have it all in one, concise video. Information should be easy to get, and fun to watch! And speaking of fun, we don't do your typical vinegar-and-baking-soda science here. Our science is a little more...mad! Boundaries were meant to be pushed, and this is the channel to push them! To advance, one must have full knowledge on how to advance. Knowledge is power. Those who possess knowledge have its power. And those who use that power can change the world.

Arduino compatibles and other electronics for beginners! If you're getting started with the Arduino platform you'll be interested in my experiences as I investigate several 'building blocks' that can be attached to an Arduino module. I normally source these building blocks from the Far East (China, Malaysia) but sometimes from the UK. I'll also look at the very simple C++ code you'll need to get the Arduino's microcontroller (usually, but not always, an ATMEL MEGA328P) to 'do stuff' with the modules - much easier than you might think. Some simple electronics, analogue as well as digital, can go a long way in glueing components together so I'll explore these as they're needed for my projects. Any other interesting gadgets and gizmos that I might find along the way!

Justajolt here! This is Nerf, seasoned with a healthy sprinkling of self deprecating humour, British sarcasm, down-to-earth humanity and as little money spent as possible. And stuff burning. Expect mods, makes, blaster abuse and destruction from sunny Leeds, UK! I love cramming the best Nerf guns with more IMRs than is healthy. It should be illegal. I'm coming for you, new Nerf blasters of 2021! I also publish handy, informative, serious mod and how to guides. And burn stuff. Uploads also include: Gear, loadouts, Nerf War footage and tactical chat about the regular Nerf events and UK Nerf Wars I attend (the funnest workout ever!) in Leeds and Bradford (West Yorkshire). And I burn stuff. It's all one big Nerf party in Leeds and Bradford! I've been inspired by Drac, Walcom, Coop72 and FDS; I've been well instructed on forums like Britnerf, Nerf Reddit etc... So I'm giving something back. I publish whenever I have something worth sharing. Enjoy! Justajolt ^_^

Capturing the natural beauty of chemistry I find that chemistry is often taught poorly or without a purpose. Because of this, people tend to lose interest and sometimes even start to hate it. In each video that I make, I try to balance theory with purpose. My goal is to capture the natural beauty of chemistry in fun and interesting ways. In terms of education, I have a BSc in Biochemistry, with a minor in pharmacology. However, I've always been a lot more drawn to applied chemistry. So after finishing my degree, I worked as a lab tech in an organic lab, and then as a chemistry grad student. However, I ended up leaving my graduate studies early to focus on this channel. Now, making chemistry videos has become my full-time job! Sponsorships and related business inquiries: nilered@endcard.com Other inquiries: admin@nilered.ca

Built on top of node.js, it provides a light-weight, browser-based editor that makes it easy to integrate different streams of both physical and digital events. Its light-weight nature makes it ideal to run at the edge of the network, such as on a Raspberry Pi, but also well suited to running in the cloud. It provides a framework for easily adding new nodes into its palette to extends its capabilities. Originally developed by the IBM Emerging Technologies team, it is now a project of the OpenJS Foundation. This channel is where we'll share tutorials, walk-throughs and general updates about the project. Or at least, that's the theory.

Copyright ¬© Dave Beaty 2019 www.thenimitzencounters.com Description On the morning of November 14th, 2004, 90 miles of the coast of California near San Diego, the Nimitz Carrier Strike Group was conducting routine training and aerial defense exercises. No one could have known what would soon confront the sailors and naval aviators of the Black Aces Fighter Squadron. Unknown craft would appear that forever changed those that encountered them. The answers to the question of ‚Äúwhat are they?‚Äù remains unknown. After 13 years of cloaked secrecy this True Story can finally be told.

We talk to experts in their field and get the lowdown on the latest breakthroughs in science and technology while exploring the vast complexities of modern civilization and human society. We don't pretend to have any answers but we might brush up against a few along the way. Heck, we might just learn something.

My YouTube channel features emergency preparedness topics and related gear reviews. Since I live and work in the greater Seattle area, my focus is on ‚ÄúUrban‚Äù preparedness and not on Rural environment related concepts. My goal is to provide video content that is family-friendly, entertaining and accessible to a wide audience. I work in software engineering, so many of the projects and gear testing that I upload to YouTube leverage engineering skills; planning, organization, scientific method testing and documentation. I try to treat all of my large projects or ‚Äúkits‚Äù as open-source projects that viewers can leverage and customize to their own set of needs.

I'm a science maniac that loves building huge lasers and playing with electricity and chemicals. Officially I am a chemist, but I get my hands dirty in all aspects of mad science. When it comes to building stuff, I'm certainly an "old school" kind of maker as I'd rather use a hacksaw and soldering iron than design 3D parts on a computer. I started this channel in 2006 and handle all of the building, filming, and editing by myself. This means you'll never get a set upload schedule. :D What I lack in video editing skills I try to make up with crazy and original content! Need help with a project? Or do you just want to chat about science projects with other tinkerers? If so, join my Discord server! There are TONS of knowledgeable members there, so if I can't help with a question, they can!

On my channel I have a variety of tutorials and creations for my viewers to watch, use, and enjoy. In order to inspire other builders like ourselves we supply viewers with in depth mechanism videos, and easy to follow instructions in order to get them started.

@tinyhouseman‚Ä¢8.37K subscribers
I built this tiny house for several reasons. First off, I decided that buying a large or even a midsized home would be something that I would never actually be able to afford with a mortgage and taxes, the high cost of utilities, upkeep and such and still be able to eat. My health was deteriorating and I didn't want to be a homeless person because I couldn't afford the rising cost of rent. Secondly, I do believe that we should live more responsibly when it comes to the issue of our environmental health. I'm not trying to judge here. If I had a family with several kids to raise, then of course I wouldn't be living in such a small environment. But, being there is only me, I don't believe that more is necessary. I like the idea of being able to move around time to time to see all the fascinating things that our country has to show us and hopefully find that little spot of paradise that we have all dreamed about. I have been living in it for the past (almost) 2 years now and really love it

All about Tiny Houses, Tree Houses, Small Houses, Backyard Art Studios, Houseboats, Campers, Cool Architecture, and DIY thrift, salvage, and re-use (with a dash of Deek's art work). "RelaxshacksDOTcom" is hosted by Derek "Deek" Diedricksen, former host of HGTV's "Tiny House Builders" and "Extreme Small Spaces", and author of "Humble Homes, Simple Shacks", and "Microshelters". Deek and his brother Dustin travel the US touring and filming tiny houses, and more, as they build and design their own works (often featured) at the same time.

Uplifting Emotional Trance
@upliftingemotionaltrance‚Ä¢23.9K subscribers
Firstly can I say thank you to all who comment on my tunes and listen to them, it means a lot to me, after all I would not keep uploading if I thought no one cared :) I am an Englishman living in the UK and my name is Jason. I only listen to the very best in emotional, melodic, progressive, epic, vocal and uplifting trance, so hopefully you will find what you like here. I have created this channel simply to share with you my most favourite trance tracks. I also have two other channels, both of which can be found below on the 'featured channels' section. One includes single upload videos rather than in the style of mixes as this channel is and the other is a trance label of mine called Trancer Recordings. Facebook page for this channel: https://www.facebook.com/upliftingemotionaltrancechannel My previous Facebook page which I lost access to: https://www.facebook.com/upliftingemotionaltrancemusic

TKJ Electronics

The idea and main purpose with TKJ Electronics was to create a company whose main interest would be to demonstrate and create a wide spectre of electronic development boards, at reasonable costs. The idea was to either create development boards which he would be interested in buying for himself, as a hobbyist, or to find and review pre-existing ones that would suit his needs. TKJ Electronics' slogan is "Development with ease", and we try our best to satisfy our customers needs, either by doing consultancy for them (hardware/software), or by making the right electronic product for them. We hope that our boards will help students, hobbyists, universities and other people interested in electronics getting started with electronics development themselves!

I've been building things for as long as I can remember. It all started when my dad exposed me to plastic model building and soldering when I was around 4 years old. That set me on a path to building increasingly complex things and becoming an engineer. My goal is to do the same for as many people as possible by exposing them to the joy of engineering, fabricating and creating things out of nothing. If I'm lucky a few people may become engineers, which would be great for the world. Engineering is awesome. If you're interested in sending me something: P.O. Box 78470 Charlotte, NC 28271
